## Contents

The [AlexaSkill](AlexaSkill) folder contains the code and related files for our Alexa skill created in Node.js. This is hosted on AWS Lambda.

The [DirectionServiceAPI](DirectionServiceAPI) contains the ASP.NET Web API that connects Alexa with Unity. This is hosted on Microsoft Azure at [cchackers.azurewebsites.net](http://cchackers.azurewebsites.net) (note there are only a few endpoints, and the site does not have a home page).

The Unity project is not included here because a large chunk of it is binary files, but we may host it in the future.
